INSTRUCTIONS

1. Logical Operators
		Define a Solidity contract called LogicalOperators.
		Add two Boolean variables to the contract: a and b, and initialize them to true and false, respectively.
		Write a function called logicalOperations that returns the results of the following logical operations:
		a && b
		a || b
		!a
		!b
		Compile and deploy the contract, and test the logicalOperations function to verify that it returns the expected results.

2. A simple smart contract to transfer Ether.
		Create a simple smart contract using Solidity that can receive and send ether to another address (Individual)
